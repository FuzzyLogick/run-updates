# A simple python script that runs updates and does housekeeping for my Kali machine. I wrote this to practice Python.

This script does several things:

1) runs apt-get update
2) runs apt-get upgrade
3) runs apt-get dist-upgrade
4) runs apt-get clean
5) runs apt-get autoclean
6) runs apt-get remove
7) runs apt-get autoremove
8) runs updatedb


This was originally written as a Bash script to help me automate updating my Kali machine.  Autoupdates done by the Distro are disabled by me,
becuase I want to update at a time of my choosing, not when I'm told to.  

To help me practice Python, I converted the Bash script to Py.   Configure this simple script however you want, or not.
